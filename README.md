## The Business We Serve  

**CloudTech** is a **tech support company** delivering **24/7 service** to thousands of customers.  
When a customer faces an issue with our cloud, network, or software services, they **raise a ticket**.  
Our **engineers** are dispatched to resolve it — **within 24 hours** to meet our **SLA commitment**.

## The Challenge  

With **hundreds of tickets raised daily**, **manual tracking is impossible**:

| Problem | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **No real-time visibility** | Breaches go unnoticed |
| **Manual Excel reports** | 3–5 hours/week wasted |
| **No agent-level insights** | Lazy or overloaded engineers hidden |
| **No trends over time** | Cannot spot weekly/monthly decline |
| **Customer satisfaction at risk** | Churn, bad reviews, lost revenue |

> **One missed SLA = one angry customer. Ten missed = a reputation crisis.**
